# 🍎 Calorie Prediction System 🏃️‍♂️  

This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the number of calories burned during an activity based on user inputs such as gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The system is powered by a trained machine learning model and provides an easy-to-use web interface for users to input their data.
